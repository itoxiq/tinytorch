# TinyTorch

This repository is a copy of the TinyTorch project from the ML Systems Book:
https://github.com/mlsysbook/TinyTorch

Notes:

-   **Provenance:** Forked/derived from `mlsysbook/TinyTorch` and adapted for
    the "Machine learning systems from scratch" module used at HAW Landshut.
-   **Setup:** This copy uses a `uv`-based setup (see `setup-uv.sh` and
    `QUICKSTART_UV.md`) and includes a few small fixes to integrate with the
    coursework and local environment.
