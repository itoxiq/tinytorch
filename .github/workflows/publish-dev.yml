# This workflow builds and deploys the dev site to /dev/ subdirectory
# The dev site will be accessible at: https://mlsysbook.github.io/TinyTorch/dev/

# - Live site: deployed to root (/) when main branch is pushed
# - Dev site: deployed to /dev/ subdirectory when dev branch is pushed
# 
# Setup: Configure GitHub Pages in repo Settings → Pages to serve from 'gh-pages' branch
