    "# 1. Introduction - What is Fair Benchmarking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmarking in ML systems isn't just timing code - it's about making fair, reproducible comparisons that guide real optimization decisions. Think of it like standardized testing: everyone takes the same test under the same conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider comparing three models: a base CNN, a quantized version, and a pruned version. Without proper benchmarking, you might conclude the quantized model is \"fastest\" because you measured it when your CPU was idle, while testing the others during peak system load. Fair benchmarking controls for these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge: ML models have multiple competing objectives (accuracy vs speed vs memory), measurements can be noisy, and \"faster\" depends on your hardware and use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benchmarking as a Systems Engineering Discipline\n",
    "\n",
    "Professional ML benchmarking requires understanding measurement uncertainty and controlling for confounding factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Foundations**: We need enough measurements to achieve statistical significance. Running a model once tells you nothing about its true performance - you need distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**System Noise Sources**:\n",
    "- **Thermal throttling**: CPU frequency drops when hot\n",
    "- **Background processes**: OS interrupts and other applications\n",
    "- **Memory pressure**: Garbage collection, cache misses\n",
    "- **Network interference**: For distributed models\n",

    "- Same measurement methodology\n",
    "- Statistical significance testing\n",

    "\n",
    "Which is \"best\"? It depends on your constraints:\n",
    "- **Server deployment**: Model A (accuracy matters most)\n",
    "- **Mobile app**: Model C (memory/latency critical)\n",

    "### Why Optimization Comparison is Complex\n",
    "\n",
    "When you optimize a model, you're making trade-offs across multiple dimensions simultaneously:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Optimization Impact Matrix:\n",

    "2. **Calculates efficiency ratios**: Accuracy per MB, accuracy per ms\n",

    "## 4.4 MLPerf Principles - Industry-Standard Benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into optimization strategies, let's learn from **MLPerf** - the industry-standard ML benchmarking framework. Understanding MLPerf principles will ground your capstone competition in professional ML systems evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is MLPerf?\n",
    "\n",
    "MLPerf is the industry-standard benchmark suite for measuring ML system performance. Think of it as the \"Olympics\" of ML systems, but with rigorous scientific methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Created by:** MLCommons (Google, NVIDIA, Intel, universities)\n",
    "- **Used by:** All major ML hardware/software companies\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Fair, reproducible comparison of ML systems\n",
    "- **Impact:** Drives billions in hardware/software decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core MLPerf Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Reproducibility**\n",
    "- Exact hardware specifications reported\n",
    "- Software versions documented\n",
    "- Random seeds controlled\n",
    "- Multiple runs required for statistical validity\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Standardization**\n",
    "- Fixed model architectures (everyone runs the same models)\n",
    "- Fixed datasets (same training/test data)\n",
    "- Fixed quality targets (must achieve X% accuracy)\n",
    "- Fair comparison (apples-to-apples)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Divisions for Different Goals**\n",
    "\n",
    "MLPerf has TWO main divisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔒 Closed Division** (Strict Rules):\n",
    "- Use provided model architectures exactly\n",
    "- Use provided datasets exactly\n",
    "- Can optimize: training algorithms, hardware, software stack\n",
    "- **Goal:** Fair comparison of SYSTEMS (not algorithms)\n",
    "- Example: \"Which GPU trains ResNet-50 fastest?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔓 Open Division** (Flexible Rules):\n",
    "- Modify model architectures\n",
    "- Use different datasets\n",
    "- Novel algorithms allowed\n",
    "- **Goal:** Show innovation and new approaches\n",
    "- Example: \"New pruning technique achieves 10x speedup!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Two Divisions?**\n",
    "- Closed: Answers \"What's the best hardware/software for X?\"\n",
    "- Open: Answers \"What's the best algorithm/innovation for Y?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### MLPerf Inference Benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "MLPerf Inference (what we care about) measures:\n",
    "- **Latency:** Single-stream inference time\n",
    "- **Throughput:** Offline batch processing speed\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** Must meet quality targets\n",
    "- **Power:** Energy efficiency (advanced)\n",
    "\n",
    "Common scenarios:\n",
    "- **Server:** Datacenter deployment (high throughput)\n",
    "- **Edge:** On-device inference (low latency, low power)\n",
    "- **Mobile:** Smartphone deployment (tiny models)\n",
    "\n",
    "### TinyMLPerf - MLPerf for Tiny Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "TinyMLPerf is MLPerf for embedded/edge devices:\n",
    "- Models <1MB\n",
    "- Latency <100ms\n",
    "- Power <10mW\n",
    "- Real deployment constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is what inspires your capstone!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways for Your Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reproducibility Matters:** Document everything\n",
    "2. **Fair Comparison:** Same baseline for everyone\n",
    "3. **Multiple Metrics:** Not just accuracy - latency, memory, energy\n",
    "4. **Real Constraints:** Optimize for actual deployment scenarios\n",
    "5. **Closed vs Open:** Understand the rules of your competition\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Module 20**, you'll participate in **TinyMLPerf-style competition** following these principles!"

    "## 4.5 Normalized Metrics - Fair Comparison Across Different Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Hardware Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine two students submit their optimizations:\n",
    "- **Alice** (M3 Mac, 16GB RAM): \"My model runs at 50ms latency!\"\n",
    "- **Bob** (2015 laptop, 4GB RAM): \"My model runs at 200ms latency!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Who optimized better? **You can't tell from raw numbers!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice's hardware is 4x faster. If Bob achieved 200ms on old hardware, he might have optimized MORE aggressively than Alice. Raw metrics are unfair.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Relative Improvement Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of absolute performance, measure **relative improvement** from YOUR baseline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Speedup = Baseline Latency / Optimized Latency\n",
    "Compression Ratio = Baseline Memory / Optimized Memory  \n",
    "Accuracy Delta = Optimized Accuracy - Baseline Accuracy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Alice: 100ms → 50ms = **2.0x speedup** ✓\n",
    "- Bob: 400ms → 200ms = **2.0x speedup** ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "Now they're fairly compared! Both achieved 2x speedup on their hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Normalized Metrics for TorchPerf Olympics\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Speedup (for Latency Sprint)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "speedup = baseline_latency / optimized_latency\n",
    "# Higher is better: 2.5x means 2.5 times faster\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Compression Ratio (for Memory Challenge)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "compression_ratio = baseline_memory / optimized_memory\n",
    "# Higher is better: 4.0x means 4 times smaller\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Accuracy Preservation (for All Events)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "accuracy_delta = optimized_accuracy - baseline_accuracy\n",
    "# Closer to 0 is better: -0.02 means 2% accuracy drop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Efficiency Score (for All-Around)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "efficiency = (speedup * compression_ratio) / max(1.0, abs(accuracy_delta))\n",
    "# Balances all metrics\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters for Your Competition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without normalization:**\n",
    "- Newest hardware wins unfairly\n",
    "- Focus shifts to \"who has the best laptop\"\n",
    "- Optimization skill doesn't matter\n",
    "\n",
    "**With normalization:**\n",
    "- Everyone competes on **optimization skill**\n",
    "- Hardware differences are eliminated\n",
    "- Focus is on relative improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real MLPerf Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "NVIDIA A100 submission: 2.1ms (absolute) → 3.5x speedup (relative)\n",
    "Google TPU submission: 1.8ms (absolute) → 4.2x speedup (relative)\n",
    "\n",
    "Winner: Google (better speedup despite slower absolute time)\n",

    "## 4.6 Understanding Measurement Confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've built the benchmarking infrastructure, let's understand how to interpret results and make valid comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Significance in Benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing two models, you need to ensure differences are real, not noise:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Model A: 5.2ms ± 0.3ms (95% CI: [4.9, 5.5])\n",
    "Model B: 4.8ms ± 0.4ms (95% CI: [4.4, 5.2])\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Is Model B actually faster?\n",
    "Answer: Confidence intervals overlap → difference might be noise\n",
    "         Need more runs or larger difference to claim improvement\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ablation Studies: Understanding Individual Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Professional ML engineers use **ablation studies** to understand what each optimization contributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Baseline:           Accuracy: 89%, Latency: 45ms, Memory: 12MB\n",
    "+ Quantization:     Accuracy: 88%, Latency: 30ms, Memory: 3MB   (Δ: -1%, -33%, -75%)\n",
    "+ Pruning:          Accuracy: 87%, Latency: 22ms, Memory: 2MB   (Δ: -1%, -27%, -33%)\n",
    "+ Kernel Fusion:    Accuracy: 87%, Latency: 18ms, Memory: 2MB   (Δ: 0%, -18%, 0%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: Quantization provides biggest memory reduction, fusion provides latency boost\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This systematic analysis guides optimization decisions with statistical backing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making Valid Comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "When benchmarking multiple optimization strategies, ensure you:\n",
    "1. **Use the same measurement protocol** for all variants\n",
    "2. **Run enough trials** to achieve statistical confidence\n",
    "3. **Control for confounding variables** (same hardware, same data, same environment)\n",
    "4. **Report confidence intervals** not just point estimates\n",
    "5. **Verify differences are statistically significant** before claiming improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Benchmarking Optimization Strategies\n",
