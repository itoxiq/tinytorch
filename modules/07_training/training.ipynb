    "\n",
    "Training is where the magic happens - it's the process that transforms a randomly initialized neural network into an intelligent system that can solve problems. Think of training as teaching: you show the model examples, it makes predictions, you measure how wrong it is, and then you adjust its parameters to do better next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process follows a consistent pattern across all machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forward Pass**: Input flows through the model to produce predictions\n",
    "2. **Loss Calculation**: Compare predictions to true answers\n",
    "3. **Backward Pass**: Compute gradients showing how to improve\n",
    "4. **Parameter Update**: Adjust model weights using an optimizer\n",
    "5. **Repeat**: Continue until the model learns the pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "But production training systems need much more than this basic loop. They need learning rate scheduling (starting fast, slowing down), gradient clipping (preventing exploding gradients), checkpointing (saving progress), and evaluation modes (testing without learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we're building today:**\n",
    "- A complete `Trainer` class that orchestrates the entire learning process\n",
    "- Learning rate scheduling that adapts during training\n",
    "- Gradient clipping that prevents training instability\n",

    "### Model Checkpointing - Saving Your Progress\n",
    "\n",
    "Checkpointing is like saving your progress in a video game - it lets you pause training, resume later, or share your trained model with others. Without checkpointing, you'd have to retrain from scratch every time!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Checkpointing Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine training a large model for 10 hours, then your computer crashes. Without checkpoints, you lose everything. With checkpoints, you can:\n",
    "- **Resume training** after interruptions (power failure, crashes, etc.)\n",
    "- **Share models** with teammates or students\n",
    "- **Deploy models** to production systems\n",
    "- **Compare versions** to see which trained model works best\n",
    "- **Use pre-trained models** without waiting for training\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Gets Saved\n",
    "\n",
    "A checkpoint is a dictionary containing everything needed to restore your model:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Checkpoint Dictionary:\n",
    "{\n",
    "    'model_params': [array1, array2, ...],  # All weight matrices\n",
    "    'config': {'layers': 2, 'dim': 32},     # Model architecture\n",
    "    'metadata': {'loss': 0.089, 'step': 5000}  # Training info\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a complete snapshot of your model at a specific moment in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Two Levels of Checkpointing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Low-level** (save_checkpoint/load_checkpoint): For custom training loops, just save what you need\n",
    "2. **High-level** (Trainer.save_checkpoint): Saves complete training state including optimizer and scheduler\n",

    "- All tests pass ✅ (validated by `test_module()`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ready for Next Steps\n",
    "Your training implementation enables sophisticated model training with proper scheduling, stability controls, and state management.\n",
    "Export with: `tito module complete 07`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next**: Module 08 will add DataLoader for efficient data pipeline management, completing the full training infrastructure needed for the MLP milestone!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Systems Insights Gained\n",
    "- Learning rate scheduling often provides better convergence than fixed rates\n",
